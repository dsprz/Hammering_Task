The use of this code is to perform a hammering task where the head of a hammer (part of the robot) hits the head of the nail. 

- addFiles: files to add/modify to modify the simulation environment (add the table, the nail and the hammer)
- plugin: creation of a force sensor at the head of the nail as a mean to compare impact on the nail and force measured on the robot's hand
